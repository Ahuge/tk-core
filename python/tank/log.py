        Generates standard logger objects for Toolkit.

        If you want to add standard toolkit logging to your code,
        the easiest way is to include the following at the top of
        your python file::

            import sgtk
            logger = sgtk.LogManager.get_logger(__name__)

        This will pick up the module hierarchy of your code and
        parent it under the standard Toolkit logger.

                  If you are developing a Toolkit app, framework or engine,
                  you typically want to use :meth:`sgtk.platform.get_logger`
                  for your logging.

        .. note:: To output logging to screen or to a console,
                  we recommend using the :meth:`initialize_custom_handler`
                  convenience method.

        :param log_name: Name of logger to create. This name will be parented under
                         the sgtk namespace. If the name begins with ``tank.``, it will

        Sometimes it is useful to log runtime statistics about
        how long time a certain method takes to execute. In the
        case of Toolkit, it is particularly helpful when debugging
        issues to do with I/O or cloud connectivity.
